        <p>200 OK: Indicates that the request was successful. This is the standard response for successful HTTP
            requests.
        </p>
        <p>201 Created: Used when a new resource is successfully created as a result of a POST request. The response
            body
            typically contains details about the newly created resource.</p>
        <p>400 Bad Request: Signifies that the server cannot process the request due to invalid syntax or parameters in
            the
            request. It's typically used when the client sends a malformed request.</p>
        <p>401 Unauthorized: Indicates that the request requires user authentication. The client needs to provide valid
            credentials (e.g., username and password) to access the resource.</p>
        <p>403 Forbidden: Denotes that the server understood the request, but the client is not allowed to access the
            requested resource. Unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the server.</p>
        <p>404 Not Found: Indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server. It's commonly used
            when
            the server cannot locate the requested resource.</p>
        <p>500 Internal Server Error: Signifies that something went wrong on the server while processing the request,
            and it
            couldn't fulfill the request due to an unexpected condition. This is a generic error message for server-side
            errors.</p>
